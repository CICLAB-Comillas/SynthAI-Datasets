## About the project ℹ️

***SynthAI-Dataset*** provides an *easy* and *ready-to-use tool* to generate synthetic datasets with the OpenAI API.


Here is an example of how to create a dataset of 10 samples with *SynthAI-Dataset* by the only input of a few args.

## How to use ⏩

*SynthAI-Dataset* was designed

Below you can see a demo.


### Libraries and dependencies 📚

 > It is recommended to use Python version 3.10.11 to avoid possible incompatibilities with dependencies and libraries

The first step is to you will need to install the required dependencies. Fortunately, the `requirements.txt` contains all the necessary libraries to run the code without errors. 

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Example 🪄

Once you have all the requirements installed, you can now run the base example with the following command in a console.

```console
python generate_dataset.py -k <your_openai_api_key> -n <samples> -b <batches>
```

TODO: Add a brief definition of each argument

 ## Fine tune 🎨

 The base example is fine, but I suppose that you are here for your own custom dataset, so a few changes must be done. The are basically **2 main things** you must change in other to accomplish your objective:

 - Declare your own random parameters for the prompt
 -
